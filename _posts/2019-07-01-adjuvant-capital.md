# I designed and developed Adjuvant Capital's website and identity.

Created [@Manoverboard](https://manoverboard.com) in 2019

This website was an [Honourable Mention for Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/adjuvant-capital){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and a [Typewolf site of the day](https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/adjuvant-capital){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (July 20, 2019).&nbsp; The Orpheus and GT America Sans/Mono type pairing in I chose has also been mentioned in several design blogs across the net.

Adjuvant Capital is an investment firm focused on public health. This project was a special one for me in particular since we had tried many different directions with no success, until I got my hands onto it. The soft pastel colour palette was inspired by a game that a member of the Adjuvant team was entranced by.
