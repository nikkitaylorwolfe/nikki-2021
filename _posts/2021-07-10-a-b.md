# Andrew Boardman’s personal website development.
Created [@Manoverboard](https://manoverboard.com) in 2019

Working for and with Andrew at Manoverboard since 2018 has been fueled by learning.  This project was especially challenging as my first [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) website. Together we chose Forestryas the CMS, and Jekyllas the static site generator. You can [read about the endeavor](https://manoverboard.com/blog/jekyll-and-forestry-sitting-in-tree/) in the blog post I wrote at the time.

His personal website was of course designed by himself—and wonderfully and uniquely so. I was happy to translate the design into a highly portable website, soon to be moved to our new favourite CMS: [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/).
