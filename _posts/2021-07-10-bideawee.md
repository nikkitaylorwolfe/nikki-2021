# I designed and developed Bideawee’s website to follow their new brand identity.

Created [@Manoverboard](https://manoverboard.com) in 2020

Website was an [Honourable Mention for Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/sites/bideawee){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

In their own words, [Bideawee](https://www.bideawee.org/) is "Finding loving homes for rescued animals since 1903. Bideawee’s mission is to be Greater New York’s leader in rescuing, caring for, and placing homeless cats and dogs with people who love them."

After designing their new website according to their recent rebrand, I developed the rescue shelter a highly customized WordPress website. Integrating the new shelter software ([ShelterLuv](https://www.shelterluv.com/)) Bideawee uses was a fun challenge for this project. I used the ShelterLuv API to create them a highly customized Adopt page, and automatically generating, unique pet pages.
