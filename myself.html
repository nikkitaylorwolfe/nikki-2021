            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>In the world of all things tech, I'm learning React, and teaching Jekyll and all things Jamstack at my workplace. I'm striving to become more specialized in my field: web accessibility, and universal design.</p>
            <p>Outside of tech, I will be attending classes in the realm of philosophy and Medieval history. Collecting things is also an interesting part of human nature. I'm collecting the entirety of the Tomb Raider and Castlevania game series.</p>
